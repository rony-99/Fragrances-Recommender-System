# Fragrances Recommender System

## Overview
The **Fragrances Recommender System** is designed to provide personalized perfume recommendations based on customer preferences and fragrance reviews. It is tailored to assist businesses, such as Macy's, in enhancing customer engagement and improving satisfaction by delivering tailored suggestions.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Matches user-input attributes (e.g., "exotic") with fragrance reviews.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes reviews for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifies key themes in reviews using advanced NLP techniques like BERT.
- **Customer Insights**: Highlights popular attributes and products customers desire.
- **API Integration**: Built to support online and in-store applications.

## Data Source
- Scraped over **44,000 fragrance reviews** from the **Base Notes** forum up to December 2019.
- Reviews include sentiment ratings and detailed fragrance descriptions.

## Use Case
Example: A customer visits a store, looking for an "exotic" fragrance. They input their preference into the kiosk system, which recommends suitable perfumes based on historical reviews and attributes.
